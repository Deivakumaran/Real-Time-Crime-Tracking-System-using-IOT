# Real-Time-Crime-Tracking-System-using-IOT

-Usually the process of investigating a crime follows many phases like assigning a dispatch team to the crime scene, crime scene analysis (blood spatter, forensic), investigation, finding the suspect, issuing warrant. In addition to that, most of the crimes are undiscovered at the first instance. In order to reduce the effect of crime immediate action is needed. Further, this process is tedious and requires lot of paperwork. 

-This project is based on internet of thing where computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.
 The emergency button is provided in the watch which is connected to the internet. Whenever a person is in dangerous situation, he/she presses the emergency button.
 The current location of the person in danger is tracked along with latitude and longitude using Google Maps Geocoding API to reach the criminals which reduced 1/5th of the response time .
 Normally police departments use patrolling officers to limit criminal activity and maximize safety in particular areas, protecting both people and property. The alarm request is automatically routed based on shortest path algorithm.
 The distance between victim and patrol officer is calculated based on latitude and longitude and converted to km. The request is routed to nearest km of patrol officer.

-The project follows ecosystem model of networks and enterprises that are involved in the crime management system.

-Visualized the statistics of criminal records using JFreeChart.

• Role of Public  :	
 Creates Emergency Request to the near by Police/Investigator to arrive at the requested location.	Have access to the nearby Investigator’s location based on the shortest path Algorithm.

•	Role of Investigator Role:
 Manages the emergency requests which are automatically assigned from intelligent routing technique.Manages Analyst dispatch request by calling the analyst to arrive at the location.

•	Role of Blood Stain pattern Analyst:  
 The primary purpose is the collection and analysis of physical evidence when the crime has happened. In this case, Bloodstain pattern analysts examine the location and shape of blood drops, stains, puddles, and pools.  He collects, analyses and maintains all the criminal blood stain data and shares them with police department.

•	Role of forensic Analyst:  
 DNA analysts play a key role in the investigation of violent crimes. They collect, test and analyze blood samples to help provide critical evidence of how a crime happened and who committed it.
